            <p className="">
              As the youngest of four siblings,I grew up in a family that instilled strong values in me, My father,a dedicated military man,
              taught me the importance of discipline and perseverance. My mother, a nurturing small scale farmer, grounded me with her love for 
              hard work and respect for my peers and elders as well. Being raised in this environment shaped me into the person i am today.
             
              One of the most cherished traditions in my family is spending the Christmas season together with my siblings and their families
              in Ukambani, our ancestral homeland. Ukambani is a beautiful region in the eastern region of kenya know for rich cultural Heritage
              .During this time, we gather with extended family to celebrate, share stories and catch up as we strengthen our bond.
              The moments of togetherness are a constant source of joy and inspiration for me to be the man i intent to be.
